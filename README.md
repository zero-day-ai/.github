## < The Matrix Has You

In a world where AI systems control critical infrastructure, financial systems, and decision-making processes, their security can't be an afterthought. **Zero-Day.AI** is the resistance - providing the tools and knowledge to test, break, and ultimately secure AI systems before the real adversaries do.
